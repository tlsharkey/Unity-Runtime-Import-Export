Paste in this link: `https://github.com/tlsharkey/Unity-Runtime-Import-Export.git`
You may get an error saying import failed. **Paste in the link a second time.**
Unity will then import the package and display a series of errors in the Console. Unity will automatically fix all of these, you can safely clear them.
